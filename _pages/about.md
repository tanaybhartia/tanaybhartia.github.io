I am a final year Dual Degree (B.Tech + M.Tech) student in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Kharagpur](https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/), India. I am particularly interested in the field of Blockchain Technologies and System Design. Currently, I am working on my Master's Thesis Project under the guidance of Prof. [Sandip Chakraborty](https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~sandipc/).

In my four years of stay at IIT Kharagpur, I have been a member and later on head of [CodeClub, IIT Kharagpur](https://www.facebook.com/CodeClub.IITKGP/), a student body which believes in carving out young coders through workshops on algorithms, fortnightly coding contest and much more!

In my spare time, I love to play Badminton and Basketball. Moreover, I am an ardent fan of Arsenal FC and Golden State Warriors.
