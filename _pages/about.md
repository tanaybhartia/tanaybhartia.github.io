Hi!! I am a recent graduate from the [IIT Kharagpur](https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/), India with a Dual Degree (B.Tech(Honours) + M.Tech) in Computer Science and Engineering. I am particularly interested in the field of Blockchain Technologies and System Design. I worked on my Master's Thesis Project () under the guidance of Prof. [Sandip Chakraborty](https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~sandipc/). I will soon be joining [Microsoft Vancouver](https://mcec.microsoft.ca/) as a Software Engineer.

In my five years of stay at IIT Kharagpur, I have been a member and later on head of [CodeClub, IIT Kharagpur](https://www.facebook.com/CodeClub.IITKGP/), a student body which believes in carving out young coders through workshops on algorithms, fortnightly coding contest and much more!

In my spare time, I love to play Badminton and Basketball. Moreover, I am an ardent fan of Arsenal FC and Golden State Warriors.
