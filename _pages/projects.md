From starting of August 2019, I have been working under the guidance of Prof. [Sandip Chakraborty](https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~sandipc/) for my Master's Thesis Project. I am designing an architecture for federated Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) provisioning using blockchain technology. The proposed architecture is free from any central broker and supports decentralisation, transparency, autonomy of service providers, immutability in information exchange for dispute-free billing and fairness for service provisioning.
